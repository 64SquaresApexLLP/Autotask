A computer is a programmable electronic machine that:
• **Processes data** - Takes input, processes it, and produces output
• **Stores information** - Can save and retrieve data
• **Executes instructions** - Follows programmed commands automatically
• **Performs calculations** - Does mathematical and logical operations

**Main Components:**
• **CPU (Processor)** - The "brain" that executes instructions
• **Memory (RAM)** - Temporary storage for active programs
• **Storage** - Hard drives/SSDs for permanent data storage
• **Input devices** - Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen
• **Output devices** - Monitor, speakers, printer

**Types of Computers:**
• **Desktop** - Stationary computers for office/home use
• **Laptop** - Portable computers with built-in components
• **Server** - Powerful computers that serve other computers
• **Mobile devices** - Smartphones, tablets with computing capabilities

**How it works:** Input → Processing → Output → Storage

**Types of Software:**
• **System Software** - Operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)
• **Application Software** - Programs like Microsoft Office, web browsers
• **Programming Software** - Tools for creating other software
• **Firmware** - Low-level software stored in hardware

**Examples:**
• **Operating Systems** - Windows 11, macOS, Ubuntu Linux
• **Productivity** - Microsoft Office, Google Workspace
• **Web Browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
• **Media** - VLC Player, Photoshop, Spotify
• **Security** - Antivirus programs, firewalls
