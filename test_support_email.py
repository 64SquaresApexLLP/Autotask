    Hi Support Team,
    
    I'm having a critical issue with my office printer. It's completely stopped working and I have important documents to print for a meeting in 2 hours.
    
    Details:
    - Printer model: HP LaserJet Pro M404n
    - Error message: "Paper jam" but there's no paper stuck
    - I've tried restarting the printer and computer
    - The printer shows offline status
    
    This is urgent as I need to print documents for an important client meeting.
    
    Please help ASAP!
    
    Thanks,
    Test User
